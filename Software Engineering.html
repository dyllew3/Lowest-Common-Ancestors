<h2>
  Biography
</h2>
<p>
  Edsger W. Dijkstra was born in Rotterdam Amsterdam on the 11th of May
  1930. His father was a chemist and his mother was mathematician.
  In 1948 after graduating school his parents suggested that he not study
  law as he had originally planned and this led him to study maths and physics and
  then theoretical physics at the university of Leiden.
  Djikstra officialy became the Netherland's first programmer in March 1952
  by accident as through his supervisor Professor A. Haantjes, he met Adriaan
  van Wijngaarden, the director of the Computation Department at the Mathematical
  Center in Amsterdam, who offered Dijkstra a job. As he was exposed more and more
  to computing it became his sole focus.
  From 1952 to 1962 Djikstra worked at the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam while
  there he worked closely with  Bram Jan Loopstra and Carel S. Scholten. They had been
  hired to build a computer. In order to do this they followed a procedure
  </p><ul>
    <li>Decide an interface between hardware and software and write a programming
    manual </li>
    <li>
      Hardware designers had to uphold the design.
    </li>
    <li>
      Djikstra would then seperately write software for the non-existent machine.
    </li>
  </ul>
  In 1956 Djikstra solved the shortest path problem for the inauguration
 of the
  ARMAC computer however due to lack journals dedicated to automatic 
computing
  he did not get it published until 1959. This algorithm is very useful 
as it used in
  network routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) it 
can also be used
  in any system which can be represented by a graph and doesn't have any
 negative weights
  between vertices.
  A year later, Djikstra came across another problem from hardware 
engineers working on the institute's next computer:
   minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the back 
panel of the machine. As a solution, he re-discovered the algorithm 
known as Prim's spanning tree algorithm.
   The Prim's algorithm was originally developed in 1930 by Czech 
mathematician Vojtěch Jarník and later independently rediscovered and 
republished by Robert C. Prim in 1957 and Dijkstra in 1959.
   Therefore, it is also sometimes referred to as the DJP algorithm.

<p>
  While working at the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam Djikstra and a colleague
  developed a compiler for the language ALGOL 60.
  In 1960 Djikstra first described the shunting yard algorithm, the shunting yard
  algorithm is a method for parsing a mathematical expression from infix notation
  i.e. (1 + 2 * 3) to postfix notation(2 3 * 1 +) which is also known as reverse polish
  notation. This algorithm was calling the shunting yard algorithm because of the
  its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard.
 In 1962/63 Dijkstra proposed the semaphore mechanism for mutual exclusion
 algorithm for n processes (a generalization of Dekker's algorithm), which was probably
 the first published concurrent algorithm and which introduced a new area of algorithmic
 research. He also identified the deadlock problem and proposed the banker's algorithm that prevents deadlock.
</p>

<p>
  A sephamore is used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes
  in a concurrent system this is still used in concurrent systems to this day.
  The banker's algorithm is resource allocation algorithm that avoids deadlock.
  It tests safety  by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible
  amounts of all resources, and then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible
  deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation
  should be allowed to continue.
  In 1962 Djikstra moved to Eindhove and later to Nuenen where he became a professor
  in the Mathematics department at Eindhoven University of Technology. While there
  he did not enjoy the culture of the department. While there he tried to assemble
  a group of computer scientist who could work together on solving problems.
  In the late 1960s he built the THE operating system which has influenced the design
  of subsequent operating systems.
</p>
<p>
  During the 1960s computer programming was in a state of cirsis due to the difficulty
  in wirting useful and efficient computer programs required by the hardware of the time.
  While Djikstra had been programming machine code extensively in the 1950s he believed that
  the goto statement in many high level languages was due to poor structuring of a program
  . So in 1968 he wrote the paper "A Case against the GO TO Statement" which was published in CACM.
  Because the GOTO statement was a large source of errors Djikstra argued that it shouldn't be used.
  Nowadays the GOTO statement is either barely used by some but never used by most.
  In the year 1965 Djikstra introduced the mutual exclusion problem for n processes while also
  discussing a solution to it. During 1965 he also formulated the dining philospopher's problem
  to show synchronisation issues. This was most likely the first published concurrent
  algorithm. In 1968 he then went on to write the paper  'Cooperating sequential processes' which
  is the origin for the concurrent programming field. In this paper he discussed the notion
  of mutual exclusion(mutex) he also proposed the first synchronisation mechanism
  for concurrent processes.

  In August 1973 Djikstra began working for the Burroughs Corporation a company known at the time
  for the production of computers based on an innovative hardware architecture,
  he worked as research fellow for the company. His duties were occasionally visiting some of the company's
  research centers in a year and carrying on his own research whcih he did in his
  study on the second floor of his home in Neuenen. Due to this work he reduced his working
  times in the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of
  the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues
  scientific articles, looking at all aspects – notation, organisation, presentation, language, content etc.
  The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles.
  He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series (described below), most of them
  technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.
</p>
<p>
  From the 1970s Djikstra's chief interest was formal verification. In 
1976
  Djikstra published a book called "A Discipline of Programming" in this
 he advocated
  a method of systematic development of programs together with their 
correctness
  proofs. In his exposition he used his  'Guarded Command Language'.
  In 1984 Djikstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the 
computer
  science department at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984.
  Dijkstra worked in Austin until his retirement in November 1999. To 
mark the
  occasion and to celebrate his forty-plus years of seminal 
contributions to
  computing science, the Department of Computer Sciences organized a 
symposium, which took place on his 70th birthday in May 2000
</p>
<p>
  Djikstra and his wife moved back to his original house in Nuenen where he found
  that he had only months to live. He said that he wanted to retire in Austin
  Texas but to die in the Netherlands.
  Djikstra died on 6 August 2002 after a long struggle with cancer.
